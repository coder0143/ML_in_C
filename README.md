# ML_in_C
## Coding neural networks and various other models from scratch in C. 
* [Project1](https://github.com/coder0143/ML_in_C/blob/main/nn_basic.c) - Basic Linear Regression mechanics in C <br/>
  A very basic linear regression algorithm with two parameters, output shows reducing loss over time. 
* [Project2](https://github.com/coder0143/ML_in_C/blob/main/nn_lr.c) - A logistic regression based classifier for a classification task in c along with csv file I/O interfacing in pure C with no libraries. <br/>
  A logistic regression model which takes in input from train.csv, 2 independent variables and a dependent variable.
* Project3 - Micrograd implemented in c++
